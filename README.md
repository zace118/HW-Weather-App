# [Weather App](https://zace118.github.io/HW-Weather-App/)
A simple weather forecast app. This was one of my favorite assignments because this was the first time I felt that "click"; that "Ah hah!" moment that makes you feel like you're on top of the world. This was an assignment that heavily relied on API/AJAX calls and even uses Geolocation on the user to find where they are to update the weather forecast accordingly.
